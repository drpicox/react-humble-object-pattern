## Performance Summary

| Implementation        | Average Time (ms) | Type            | Speedup Factor |
|----------------------|-------------------|-----------------|----------------|
| Plain Controller     | 7-10              | Logic only      | ~175x          |
| Redux Slice          | 7-11              | Logic only      | ~175x          |
| Plain Humble Component | 1250-1300       | Full UI testing | 1x (baseline)  |
| Plain Smart Component | 1250-1300        | Full UI testing | 1x (baseline)  |
| Redux Component      | 1250-1350         | Full UI testing | 1x (baseline)  |

This confirms that the testing approach is consistent across all implementations. The performance benefits come from testing logic in isolation rather than through UI components, regardless of the state management approach used.
